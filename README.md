# üè¢ Enterprise Infrastructure IT & Security Lab

This repository is my **umbrella project**, where I simulate the design, deployment, and security of a modern enterprise IT environment.  

The goal is to build a **realistic, evolving infrastructure** ‚Äî starting from the core network foundation and adding **IT administration** and **security layers** step by step.  
Each project in this repo represents a **different piece of the enterprise puzzle**: networking, Active Directory, device management, cloud identity, endpoint security, and more.  

Think of this repo as a **live enterprise lab**: over time, I continue adding new ‚Äúmodules‚Äù (projects) that extend the environment, just like how a real organization grows and strengthens its infrastructure.
